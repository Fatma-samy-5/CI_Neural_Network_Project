This repository will host our implementation of a neural network library from scratch using only Python and NumPy. The project will later include:

A modular NN library (layers, activations, loss functions, optimizer, model class).
A demo solving the XOR problem using our custom library.
An autoencoder for MNIST image reconstruction.
Using the trained encoder as a feature extractor for SVM classification.
A comparison against TensorFlow/Keras implementations.
